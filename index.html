      <p><br>Pebbles are small, smooth stones that are  found on the beaches.<br> They are formed when larger rocks are worn down by the constant pounding of waves, water, or wind.<br>
 Pebbles are often rounded or oval in shape.
Pebbles are typically smooth to the touch, with a glossy or matte finish.<br>
 Pebbles can be found in a wide range of colors, including gray, brown, white, black, and various shades of red, orange, and yellow.<br>
